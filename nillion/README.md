Secure personal genomics using cryptography


This branch contain code for splitting genome data into 110KB chunks and storing them on filecoin via lighthouse.

cd into filecoin_rust directory to check the code for splitting the genome data text file into 110kb chunks and then storing them on the lighthouse.

You can retrive chunk one at a time with the code in the store_retrive directory. the filename is nillion_lighthouse.py
